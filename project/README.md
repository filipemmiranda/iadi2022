## Introduction

The topic for this year is an application to manage a fleet of delivery trucks in a carrier company. The core of our concerns lies in managing the entry, exit, and change of state of packages in the system as they are shipped, transported between distribution hubs, and delivered to the destination. The company has a series of storage locations (hubs) where packages are delivered and picked up. 

The actors in this system are the following: Client, Driver, Hub worker, and Manager.

Each package has a history of states in the system, which is a ordered and timed list of states. The states are the following:
Awaiting entry (it is nowhere in the network yet), in storage (with relation to a hub), in transit (with relation to a driver), delivered, returned to the source, lost or damaged.

Every time a package changes state, a new entry is added to the history of states, and messages are exchanged between the different roles in its process. Further messages can be exchanged between clients and the other users in the system. A client can ask questions about the status of a package, and a staff member (driver, hub worker, and manager) can respond to the client.

## Technical Details

### Server-side application 

Your server-side application should implement a layered architecture to make available a REST API for the resources of the system. The resources that are visible in the API are the following: packages, messages, hubs, and trucks.

Data resources needed to make the application work do not need to be fully managed by the API. All main operations are listed below and all auxiliary data can be inserted into the database using seed data initializers of SQL scripts.

- Packages: 

  The information of a package is the following: an identifier, a description (box/envelope/unusual size), dimensions (w, h, l), weight, origin, and the destination address.

  The package API should follow the REST architectural style and should be implemented using the Spring framework. The API should include all operations concerning this resource to support the scenario.

- Messages: 
  
  A message has one source contact (username or email), a destination contact (username or email), a subject, a body, and a timestamp. The API should include all operations concerning this resource to support the scenario.

  All messages that are added to the system should correspond to an email message sent to the destination contact. See Spring documentation to add an e-mail server connected to your application.

   All messages have a pointer to the previous message that allows one to build a thread of messages. A new thread is created with an invalid identifier of the previous message. Shipments have a thread of messages associated with them where the root message corresponds to the creation of the shipment.

- Hubs: 

  The API should allow the listing of packages in hubs and the listing of hubs. The management of hubs is not part of the API. The hubs are identified by a code, a name, an address, and a description.

- Trucks: 

  The API should allow the listing of packages in trucks and the listing of trucks. The management of trucks is not part of the API.  Each truck has one driver and one driver only drives one truck.
 
### Requirements for the Server Application

The application should be implemented using the Spring framework and Kotlin. The API should be documented using OpenAPI 3.0. The application should be developed in a layered architecture with a persistent database (H2 in a file or MySQL).

The application should implement security rules as prescribed in the course lectures. The security rules should follow the examples below and will be fixed at a later stage.

### Requirements of the Client Interface (**NEW**)

The client application should implement the following user stories:

1. As an anonymous user, I want access the application and see the main page of the application.

2. As an anonymous user, I want to type in my username and password in order to sign in.

3. As a signed-in client, I want to access the homepage and see a list with my shipments present and past, with dates, identification, and status.

4. As a signed-in client, I want to access the homepage and see a list with my messages.

5. As a signed-in client, I want to access the homepage and seeing how to create a new shipment.

6. As a signed-in client, I want to introduce the details of a package to create a new shipment and seeing it in the list of shipments in the status "Awaiting entry".

7. As a signed-in client, I want to access the list of shipments to select a shipment and seeing the details of a shipment including history and status, and messages.

8. As a signed-in client, I want to access the details of a shipment to send a message related to the package and seeing the message in the message list.

9. As a signed-in warehouse worker, I want to see the list of packages in my warehouse to filter the list by status (**NEW**) **destination, and date** and see the filtered list of packages.

10. As a signed-in warehouse worker, I want to see the filtered list of packages in my warehouse to select a package and see the details of the package.

11. As a signed-in warehouse worker, I want to access the details of a package to change it's status and see the changes in the list of packages.

12. As a signed-in warehouse worker, I want to access the details of a package to assign it to a truck and see the changes in the list of packages of the truck.

13. As a signed-in truck driver, I want to I want to see the list of packages in my truck to filter the list by (**NEW**) **destination, and date** and see the filtered list of packages.

14. As a signed-in truck driver, I want to access the details of a package to assign it to a warehouse and see the changes in the list of packages of the warehouse.

15. As a signed-in truck driver, I want to access the details of a package to change it's status and see the changes in the list of packages.

16. As a signed-in user, I want to sign-out and see the main page of the application.

The user stories should be presented in an IFML diagram (or several IFML diagrams) and a video that shows simultaneously the page of a user and the page of a worker. Your video should show the user introducing a package in the system, and then a sequence of workers changing status of the package until the client sees the "Delivered" status.

The scale is of 12 to 16 histories for groups with 3 or 4, and 8 to 12 for groups of 1 or 2. This means that 12 stories will earn 80% of the grade, each extra story is worth 5% more (all other criteria apply with relation to this). Nevertheless, the stories should provide a continuous line of action in the application.

All data that is not introduced in these stories should be provided as seed data. Recall that demos are better understood with plasible data, so make an effort to populate your database with enough convenient information.

(**NEW**) The application should be implemented using the React and Redux framework and TypeScript. The connection to the server should be performed with generated code using OpenAPI 3.0 tools (swagger editor or corresponding command line tools). The client application should implement the security rules in connection to the server-side application.

### Examples of security rules

- A client can create a shipment.

- A client can track the status and history of their shipments. 

- A client can also cancel a shipment if it is under the status `Awaiting entry`.

- A client can only see the status of a shipment, and the history of the states of a shipment.

- A driver can only change the status of a shipment to `in transit` or `delivered`.

- A hub worker can only change the status of a shipment to `in storage`.

- A manager can change the status of a shipment to any of the possible states.

- A manager can also change the destination of a shipment.

- A manager can create a shipment ( on behalf of any user)

- A manager can track the status of any package.

-  No one can edit or delete messages from a mailbox
